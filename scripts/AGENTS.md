## Repository Overview

This is a **single-package repository**.

### Architecture


This repository appears to be a **scripts** directory within a larger "boatman-ecosystem" monorepo. The structural scan returned minimal metadata, indicating either an empty/minimal scripts collection or a directory containing ad-hoc automation scripts without formal build systems, test frameworks, or CI configuration.

**Architecture characteristics:**
- No detected programming languages, build systems, or test frameworks suggest this may contain shell scripts, configuration files, or other non-compiled automation utilities
- The parent path indicates this is part of a "boatman-ecosystem" project, suggesting these scripts support a larger application ecosystem
- Lack of entrypoints and conventions implies informal organization rather than a structured application
- No CI systems detected means scripts are likely run manually or invoked by CI defined at the parent monorepo level

**Likely purpose:** Utility scripts for development, deployment, or maintenance tasks supporting the broader boatman-ecosystem project. Without file contents, the specific domains and data flows cannot be determined.
