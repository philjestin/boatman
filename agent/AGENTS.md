# AGENTS.md

## Repository Overview

This is a **single-package repository**.

### Architecture


## Architecture Summary

This repository appears to be part of a "boatman-ecosystem" project, specifically the "agent" component. Based on the structural model provided, the repository scan returned minimal metadata - no detected languages, build systems, test frameworks, CI systems, conventions, or entrypoints were identified in the automated scan.

Without access to actual source files or directory structure, the architecture cannot be definitively characterized. The repository may be in an early initialization state, may use non-standard tooling that wasn't detected by the scanner, or the scan may have encountered issues preventing proper analysis.

The name "agent" suggests this could be a service or daemon component within a larger ecosystem, but the actual implementation details, technology stack, and architectural patterns cannot be determined from the provided information alone.
