## Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the monorepo
git clone https://github.com/philjestin/boatman
cd boatman

# Build CLI first (desktop depends on it)
make build-cli

# Install frontend dependencies
cd desktop/frontend && npm install && cd ../..

# Build the application
cd desktop && wails build

# The app will be at: desktop/build/bin/boatman.app
```

### Using the Makefile

```bash
# From monorepo root
make build-cli        # Build CLI binary
make build-desktop    # Build desktop app (includes CLI)
make build-all        # Build both

# Start dev mode
make dev              # Hot reload for frontend
```

---

## Development Build

```bash
cd desktop
wails build
```

## Production Build

```bash
cd desktop
wails build -clean -production
```

## Platform-Specific Builds

```bash
# macOS
wails build -platform darwin/universal

# Windows
wails build -platform windows/amd64

# Linux
wails build -platform linux/amd64
```

Built applications will be in `desktop/build/bin/`.

---

## Verify Dependencies

```bash
wails doctor
```

This checks that all required dependencies are installed and configured.

---

## macOS Troubleshooting

If the app won't launch:

```bash
# Remove quarantine attribute
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine build/bin/boatman.app
```
