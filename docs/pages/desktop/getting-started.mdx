# Getting Started

## First Run

1. **Launch Boatman**
   ```bash
   open build/bin/boatman.app
   # or double-click the app in Finder
   ```

2. **Complete Onboarding**
   - Choose authentication method:
     - **Anthropic API**: Enter your API key
     - **Google Cloud**: Sign in with OAuth
   - Select default model (recommended: Claude Sonnet 4.5)
   - Choose approval mode:
     - **Suggest Mode**: You approve all changes (safest)
     - **Auto-Edit Mode**: Claude edits files, asks for bash commands
     - **Full Auto**: Claude has full control (use with caution)

3. **Create or Open a Project**
   - Click "New Project" and select your codebase directory
   - Or open a recent project from the sidebar

4. **Start Chatting**
   - Click "New Session" to start a conversation
   - Ask questions about your code, request changes, or get explanations

## Sessions

### Creating a Session

1. Click "New Session" button
2. Type your message in the input area
3. Claude will respond with analysis, code suggestions, or actions

### Session Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Favorites | Star important sessions for quick access |
| Tags | Organize sessions with custom tags (`#bug-fix`, `#refactor`, `#investigation`) |
| Search | Find sessions by content or metadata |
| History | View all past conversations and tasks |

---

## Agent Interactions

Claude can:
- **Read and analyze** your codebase
- **Search** for files and code patterns
- **Edit files** with your approval
- **Run bash commands** (with approval in suggest/auto-edit modes)
- **Create git commits and PRs**
- **Spawn sub-agents** for complex tasks

### Example Prompts

```
"Review this pull request and suggest improvements"
"Find why the authentication is failing"
"Refactor the payment service to use async/await"
"Explain how the database migration system works"
"Add unit tests for the user service"
```

## Approval Modes

### Suggest Mode (Safest)

- Claude proposes all changes
- You review and approve each edit/command
- Best for production codebases
- Full control over what gets changed

### Auto-Edit Mode (Balanced)

- Claude can edit files directly
- Still asks permission for bash commands
- Good for trusted environments
- Saves time on file edits

### Full Auto Mode (Risky)

- Claude has complete autonomy
- No approval required for any action
- Use **only** in sandboxed/test environments
- Maximum speed, minimum safety

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd+N` | New session |
| `Cmd+K` | Quick search |
| `Cmd+,` | Settings |
| `Cmd+\` | Toggle sidebar |
| `Cmd+Enter` | Send message |
| `Esc` | Cancel current operation |

## Git Integration

Boatman can:
- Create commits with proper messages
- Generate PRs with descriptions
- Create worktrees for parallel work (firefighter mode)
- Run git blame for code ownership

---

## Live Development Mode

For developing the desktop app itself:

```bash
wails dev
```

This starts:
- A Vite development server for fast frontend hot reload
- A dev server at `http://localhost:34115` for browser-based development
