# Storage & Data

Boatman Desktop stores all data locally on your machine. No cloud sync is used unless explicitly configured.

## Storage Locations

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `~/.boatman/config.json` | User preferences and settings |
| `~/.boatman/sessions/` | Chat sessions, tasks, and metadata |
| `~/.boatman/checkpoints/` | Workflow checkpoints (used by CLI pipeline) |
| `~/.boatman/memory/` | Per-project learning data (used by CLI pipeline) |
| `~/.claude/claude_mcp_config.json` | MCP server configurations |

---

## Session Storage

Each session is saved as a JSON file in `~/.boatman/sessions/`.

### What's Stored

- Full conversation history (all messages)
- Task list with status and metadata (plan, diff, feedback, log)
- Session state (idle, running, stopped)
- Mode and mode config (standard, firefighter, boatmanmode)
- Tags and favorite status
- Model and reasoning effort settings

### Automatic Persistence

Sessions are saved automatically:
- After each Claude command completes
- After BoatmanMode execution finishes
- When the app shuts down

## Storage Management

### View Usage

Go to **Settings > Memory** to see storage configuration.

Useful for sharing sessions with team members or moving between machines.

### Auto-Cleanup

Configure in Settings > Memory:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Max messages per session | 1000 | Older messages are trimmed |

---

## Data Privacy

- All session data stays on your local machine
- API keys are stored in `~/.boatman/config.json` but never included in session exports
- Sessions contain your prompts and Claude's responses
- No telemetry or usage data is sent externally

---

## CLI Storage

The CLI pipeline (used by BoatmanMode) stores additional data. See [Harness Storage](/harness/storage) for details on:

- **Checkpoints** (`~/.boatman/checkpoints/`) — workflow progress for crash recovery
- **Memory** (`~/.boatman/memory/`) — learned patterns and preferences per project
