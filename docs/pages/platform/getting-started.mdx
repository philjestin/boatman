# Getting Started

This guide walks you through building, running, and connecting to the Boatman Platform service.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Go | 1.24.1+ | Build the platform binary |
| Node.js | 18+ | Build the web dashboard |

---

## Building

From the monorepo root, build the platform binary:

```bash
make build-platform
```

This compiles the Go server and bundles the dashboard frontend into a single binary at `platform/boatman-platform`.

---

## Running

Start the platform server:

```bash
./platform/boatman-platform --port 8080 --data-dir ~/.boatman/platform
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--port` | HTTP port the server listens on |
| `--data-dir` | Directory for persistent data (events, memory, policies) |

---

## Verify

Confirm the server is healthy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{"status":"ok","service":"boatman-platform"}
```

---

## Connect the CLI

Add a `platform:` section to your `.boatman.yaml` configuration file so the CLI knows where to send events and retrieve shared memory:

```yaml
platform:
  server: http://localhost:8080
  org_id: my-org
  team_id: my-team
```

Once configured, CLI commands like `boatman run` will automatically report events, costs, and review results to the platform.

---

## Open the Dashboard

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser. The dashboard provides a real-time view of agent activity, cost trends, and review history across your team.

## Next Steps

- [Storage Layer](/platform/storage) -- Understand event persistence and data retention
- [HTTP API](/platform/api) -- Explore the REST endpoints the platform exposes
- [Web Dashboard](/platform/dashboard) -- Configure and customize the dashboard UI
- [CLI Integration](/platform/cli-integration) -- Deep dive into how the CLI communicates with the platform
- [Configuration](/platform/configuration) -- Full reference for server flags and environment variables
